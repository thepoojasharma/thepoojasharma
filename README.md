## 🌸 A Little About Me

I’m not here to impress — I’m here to grow.  
As a BCA graduate, I’ve realized that true growth isn’t just about skills — it’s about mindset, consistency, and heart.

This profile is a small reflection of my progress — from tech projects to personal breakthroughs.  
Every step matters, and I believe in showing up even before everything feels "ready."
