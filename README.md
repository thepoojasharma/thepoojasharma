# My Journey to Open Source Contributions

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Pooja Sharma, and I am excited to announce my intention to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025. GSoC is a global program that offers students stipends to write code for various open source projects during the summer.

## About Me
I am a beginner in the world of open source and a [Your Role/Student at Your University] with a keen interest in web development. I enjoy working on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development projects. Although I am just starting out, I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful projects.

## Goals for GSoC 2025
Through GSoC 2025, I aim to:
- Learn new technologies and improve my coding skills.
- Collaborate with experienced developers and mentors.
- Make meaningful contributions to open source projects.
- Build a strong portfolio of work.

## Projects of Interest
I am particularly interested in contributing to projects related to:
- Front-end Development: Creating interactive and responsive user interfaces using technologies like HTML, CSS taildwind bootstarp, and JavaScript.
- Back-end Development: Building robust and scalable server-side applications using technologies like Java, Node.js, and databases.
- Full-stack Development: Integrating front-end and back-end technologies to create complete web applications.

To prepare for GSoC 2025, I plan to:
- Explore and identify potential projects and organizations early.
- Read contribution guidelines and previous GSoC projects to understand expectations.
- Start contributing to small issues to get familiar with the codebase and community.
- Seek feedback and continuously improve my coding and collaboration skills.
